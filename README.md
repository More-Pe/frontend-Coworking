Coworking is a management application for shared workspaces that allows users to book rooms, manage access, and visualize information about space usage.

Access Management: Users can register their entries and exits from the rooms.

Administrative Reports: Administrators can view reports on room usage and access.

## 🙌 Acknowledgments

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the GeekHubs Academy and the instructors of the Full Stack Developer Bootcamp for providing me with the opportunity to develop my skills and knowledge in software development.

Throughout the program, I had the privilege of learning from experienced instructors who not only taught me the technical skills required to build a project like this, but also instilled in me the confidence and motivation to pursue my goals.

I also want to thank my fellow classmates for their camaraderie and collaboration, specially to Yoana. Working together on projects and sharing knowledge and ideas was an essential part of my learning experience.
